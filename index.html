    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a passionate and creative individual currently pursuing a
      Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Information Technology at NCMT,
      affiliated with Lincoln University. My interests span across
      technology, music, videography, photography, and sports. I
      enjoy expressing myself through visual and audio storytelling,
      while also staying active and disciplined through regular
      sports activities. This balance of creativity, physical activity,
      and technical learning helps me stay focused, energetic, and
      driven. I am always eager to explore new ideas, take on
      challenges, and grow personally and professionally.
